# Who is this guy?
I am a Software Engineer with more than 20 years of experience. As a developer and front-end architect, I helped to build the startup bettermarks from the ground. As lead front-end engineer in an external product development team, I contributed significantly to launching MotorVerkauf by mobile.de (eBay).
As CTO of a medium-sized company, I established a development department with multiple teams, was responsible for the agile transition, and ensured technical sustainability by planning and driving greenfield projects.
