# Who is this guy?
I am a software engineer with over 20 years of experience in the field. During my career, I have worked as a developer 
and front-end architect for the Berlin-based edtech startup bettermarks, where I was one of the main contributors. 
Additionally, as the lead front-end engineer in an external product development team, I significantly contributed to 
the successful launch of "MotorVerkauf by mobile.de" (eBay).

After that, I transitioned to the role of Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of a medium-sized company. 
In this role, I established a development department with multiple teams, was responsible for driving the agile transition, 
and ensured technical sustainability by planning and driving greenfield projects.

I have returned to bettermarks to support the migration from AngularJS to React by introducing a micro-frontend architecture.

I presented the approach of the micro-frontend architecture at the [React Advanced London](https://gitnation.com/contents/we-accidentally-built-a-plugin-sdk-for-micro-frontends).
